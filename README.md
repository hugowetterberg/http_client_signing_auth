HTTP Client Signing Authentication
----------------------------------

Simple request signing authentication inspired by the way OAuth signs requests. Useful when you need simple authentication of POST request between the server and client.

Depends on [HTTP Client](http://drupal.org/project/http_client) for doing the actual requests.
